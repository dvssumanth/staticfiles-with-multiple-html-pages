				<span>In addition to supporting the joys of reading and research, the campus library can also be a space to enjoy a visual treat. At many college 
				libraries, youâ€™ll find rotating exhibitions featuring photographs, books, maps, letters, ephemera, and other items drawn from their special 
				collections and archives.</span>

				<span>Auditorium</span>
			</div>
			<div class="right-column">
				<span>The auditorium is a central and important space in college lucky enough to have one. It is used for all types of formal assembly: 
				lectures, award ceremonies, dramatic plays, musical theatre productions, concert performances of orchestra, band, chorus, jazz band, battles of 
				the bands, dance competitions and so on. These varied events place a range of demands on the room. For all events, it is essential that everyone 
				in the room hear, clearly and enjoyably, everything that is presented. This is the goal of acoustical design for auditorium spaces.</span>

				depending on the needs of the institution operating the lab. These specialized purposes include but may not be limited to video editing, stock trading,
				3-D design, and programming.</span>
